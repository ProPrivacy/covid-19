# COVID-19 Malicious Domain Research Data

- The database is currently focused on identifying domains related to 4 text strings: 'covid', 'corona', 'virus', 'vaccine', & 'cure'
- Our primary source of data is global WHOIS datasets provided by WHOISDS dating back to the start of the pandemic. These dumps cover all major TLDs & ccTLDs
- We are also monitoring Certificate Transparency Logs in real-time for a growing number of keywords
- All of this data is then fed through our partner, VirusTotal 
- We compile detailed WHOIS data thanks to our partnership with WHOIS XML API
- We augment this data with other research compiled by cybersecurity organisations.
- The scam checker tool acts as a front-end interface for members of the public who might want to check if a domain is malcious. At the moment, this data is based on our own scans rather than additional data we have gathered
